# cc-tracker-client

This application is a collaboration written by Victor Scholz and Kevin Xie. 

The purpose of this application is to keeps track of a user's credit cards along with their associated fees and categories.

This application uses CCstack's API to show all credit cards currently available for sign-up. As a user you can browse through cards and their features.
These cards can be individually bookmarked to sign up for in the future. 

For cards that the user already owns, expirations and accrued points/cash can be totaled up and seen on the My Cards Page.
